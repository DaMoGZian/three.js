**Three.js** is a powerful, lightweight, and easy-to-use 3D JavaScript library designed to bring high-performance graphics to your browser. With support for WebGL, WebGPU (experimental), SVG, and CSS3D renderers, Three.js opens up a world of possibilities for creative 3D visualizations.

> 🖼️ **Create breathtaking 3D experiences directly in the browser!**

## ✨ Key Features

- **Lightweight & Efficient:** Minimal setup with maximum performance.
- **Cross-Browser Compatible:** Works seamlessly across all modern browsers.
- **Multiple Renderers:** Choose from WebGL, WebGPU (experimental), SVG, and CSS3D.
- **Vibrant Community:** Thousands of developers and creators contribute to its growth.
- **Extensive Documentation & Examples:** Learn, create, and innovate with ease.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Three.js makes it incredibly easy to start creating stunning 3D graphics. Here's a quick example to get you up and running:

### 🧑‍💻 Example Code: Rotating 3D Cube

```javascript
import * as THREE from 'three';

const width = window.innerWidth, height = window.innerHeight;

// Initialize scene, camera, and renderer
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(70, width / height, 0.01, 10);
camera.position.z = 1;

const scene = new THREE.Scene();

// Create a cube
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(0.2, 0.2, 0.2);
const material = new THREE.MeshNormalMaterial();
const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
scene.add(mesh);

// Create the renderer
const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({ antialias: true });
renderer.setSize(width, height);
document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement);

// Animation loop
renderer.setAnimationLoop((time) => {
  mesh.rotation.x = time / 2000;
  mesh.rotation.y = time / 1000;
  renderer.render(scene, camera);
});
```
